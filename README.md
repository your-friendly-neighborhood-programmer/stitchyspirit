# Stitchy Spirit Website

This website was created for Stitchy Spirit, a small business specializing in custom crochet products including stuffed animals, hats, scarves, baby clothes, blankets, and more.

## Technical Features

The site utilizes a single page application (SPA) architecture to:
- Decrease load times between pages
- Provide seamless transitions for browsing products
- Enhance overall user experience
- Optimize performance on both desktop and mobile devices

This implementation ensures customers can quickly browse through Stitchy Spirit's product catalog without the interruption of page reloads, creating a smooth and enjoyable shopping experience.
